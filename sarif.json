This is full remote command execution and is being actively exploited in the wild from the initial disclosure.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).If Apache Struts takes an URL in a form field and the built-in `URLValidator` functionality is utilized, an attacker can craft special input which will overload the server process. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS).An authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service when the application uses Spring AOP functionality to secure Struts action.The Struts 1 plug-in provides the ability to use existing Struts 1 Actions and Action forms within Struts 2 applications. Insufficient input validation within the `ActionMessage` class can lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).A remote code execution (RCE) attack is possible when using the Struts REST plugin with `XStream` handler to deserialize XML requests.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is possible when using outdated `XStream` library with the Struts REST plug-in for Apache Struts web framework.A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is possible against Apache Struts2 when using the `URLValidator` class to validate an `URL` provided in a form field.Apache Struts is prone to remote code execution (RCE) attack when using expressions in FreeMarker tags instead of string literals.Apache Struts is vulnerable to denial-of-service attack via REST plugin when utilizing XStream library to serilaize and deserialize XML objects.Apache Struts is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE).  This vulnerability only manifests in certain configuration environments.  This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the Apache Struts process.  This can lead to a total compromise of a systems confidentiality and integrity, and the possibility to cause a substantial availability impact also.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Apache Struts2 is vulnerable to RCE through forced double evaluation of powerful OGNL expression statements under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could leverage this to cause remote code execution (RCE) in the context of the web server that hosts a vulnerable Struts2 application.Apache Struts2 contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.  This vulnerability requires an attacker to have the ability to upload a file to the server.  Under certain conditions, a remote attacker can then change the permissions of files and directories to read only.  This will prevent certain actions from working, causing errors.  This can be used to cause a denial-of-service.Apache Struts 2 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) through forced OGNL expression statements under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could leverage this to cause RCE in the context of the web server that hosts the vulnerable Struts application.\n\n**Note**: This issue was not properly fixed and required an additional disclosure as **CVE-2021-31805** (**BDSA-2022-1011**).\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Apache Struts 2 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) through forced OGNL expression statements under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could leverage this to cause RCE in the context of the web server that hosts the vulnerable Struts application.\n\n**Note:** This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for **CVE-2020-17530** (**BDSA-2020-3670**).Apache Struts contains an out-of-memory condition vulnerability due to insufficient validation of the sizes of non-file normal form fields in multipart requests. A privileged attacker could exploit this issue by passing a multipart request to a vulnerable instance which could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition via excessive resource allocation."},"properties":{"security-severity":"","tags":["security","Direct

An attacker can leverage this flaw by sending crafted XML input to the server which may trick the XML parser into performing arbitrary operations on local resources that the attacker should not be able to control. This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability.

An attacker can leverage this flaw by sending crafted XML input to the server which may trick the XML parser into performing arbitrary operations on local resources that the attacker should not be able to control. This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module.

An attacker can leverage this flaw by sending crafted XML input to the server which may trick the XML parser into performing arbitrary operations on local resources that the attacker should not be able to control. This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component.

A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`.

This can lead to several problems ranging from an attacker being able to run stealth scans by bypassing the firewall, through sensitive information disclosure and denial-of-service (DoS), to server side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nThis CVE covers an incomplete fix to CVE-2013-7315.\n\nNOTE: The fix to CVE-2013-6429 has also turned out to be incomplete (see BDSA-2014-0002 for details).Spring Framework is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a default action in Spring MVC that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML to steal user's cookies.Spring Framework and Spring MVC are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to a failure of a method to escape certain special characters from user-supplied input. In some cases it could result in an attacker being able to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a user's session cookies.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack. An attacker can craft and send a URL with a `.bat` extension to a victim that results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered. Some input may also be reflected in the response.Spring Framework is vulnerable to path traversal. Paths provided to the `Resourceservlet` were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. `ResourceServlet` is now deprecated and `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` (and related classes) have superseded it.Pivotal's Spring Framework contains an unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability. If the Spring Framework library's `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is being used to deserialize client data, it may be possible for a remote attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on systems using Spring Framework.\n\n**Note:** All versions prior to **6.0.0-M1** (Which is a pre-release) contain the functionality that may lead to deserialization attacks depending on how the library is implemented in the product.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the way static content can be loaded. Potential attackers could leverage this flaw to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on Windows hosts.Spring Framework is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Crafted input from a remote client can be used to exploit a flaw in the way that servers running the affected software communicate with each other. This is because communication between the servers uses that user-supplied input for building requests.Spring Framework is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied input. Potential attackers can leverage this flaw to run arbitrary code on the target system by sending crafted messages. Original remediation was not implemented correctly for the 4.3.x branch.Spring Framework has a flaw in the manipulation of regular expressions within the spring-messaging module. An attacker can send a specially crafted message to the simple STOMP broker that will trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS).A cross-site tracing (*XST*) vulnerability has been discovered in spring framework. The application allows obscure request methods, such as TRACE and TRACK. These HTTP methods can be used with an existing cross-site scripting (*XSS*) vulnerability to escalate to an XST vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by utilizing an XSS vulnerability to bypass cookie protection and steal sensitive data.It was discovered that Spring Framework was vulnerable to RFD protection bypass. In some instances, depending on the browser used, an attacker could bypass the RFD attack protections via the use of a `jsessionid` path parameter.Spring Security contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this to create an `OutOfMemory` error and exhaust  system resources, triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: a follow-up to this issue was disclosed as **CVE-2021-22060** (**BDSA-2021-3236**), with further fixed releases that protect against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Spring Framework is vulnerable to log file injection due to the insufficient validation of user input in an undisclosed component. An attacker could leverage this issue in order to add arbitrary entries to a log file which could impact both the integrity issues and performance issues.\n\n**Note**: the vendor states this issue exists as a follow up to CVE-2021-22096 (BDSA-2022-0011) that protects against additional types of input and in more places of the Spring Framework codebase.Software systems using Spring Framework may be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization if they employ unsafe use of certain provided deserialization functionality. A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable endpoint by passing a maliciously crafted serialized object to that endpoint.\n\n**Note**: This issue only affects software that has been written to leverage specific deserialization functionality provided by the Spring Framework without sanitization.Spring Framework is vulnerable to a flaw in the access restrictions to the security sensitive `ClassLoader` property. The restrictions can be bypassed through alternative paths available with Java9 and later. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Note** this issue exists because the restrictions that were introduced to prevent exploitation of BDSA-2010-0001 (CVE-2010-1622) can be bypassed on platforms where Java9 and later are in use.\n\nThis vulnerability is listed as exploitable by the Cybersecurity \u0026 Infrastructure Security Agency in their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).Spring Framework is vulnerable to data binding protection bypass due to improper validation of specified disallowed fields in `DataBinders`. This could be leveraged by an attacker to bypass the suggested workaround to **CVE-2022-22965** (**BDSA-2022-0858**) if it is improperly implemented.Spring Security contains a flaw when dealing with OAuth2 access token empty scope list  responses. A remote attacker could leverage this to escalate their privileges under **all** the following conditions being met:\n\n* They act as the role of a Login Client (e.g. uses `http.oauth2Login()`).\n* They use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"SCOPE_message.write\")`) in the client application.\n* An authorization server that responds with empty scopes list is registered (RFC 6749, Section 5.1).\n\n**Note:** The role of Resource Servers (`http.oauth2ResourceServer()`) and applications that do not map authorization rules from authorized scopes (eg. `anyRequest().hasAuthority(\"ROLE_USER\")`) cannot be exploited by this vulnerability.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions. An attacker could exploit this issue by passing a crafted SpEL expression to the application which may result in a crash.Spring Framework is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) via specially crafted SpEL expressions.This vulnerability is an expression language injection issue and affects VMware SpringSource Spring Framework  when a container supports Expression Language (EL) and evaluates EL expressions in tags twice, allowing remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via multiple attributes to carry out Expression Language Injection.Spring Framework contains a deserialization flaw. This could be exploited to bypass intended security restrictions. If successful, the attacker could pass and execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system.Spring Security is vulnerable to carriage return, line feeds (CRLF) injection in the logout functionality. Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the `spring-security-redirect` parameter.An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability has been discovered in Spring Framework. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious XML file to disclose information, execute server side request forgery (SSRF) or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection due to insufficient security controls. An attacker could obtain sensitive information from system files by providing the application with a crafted XML document.This issue is present in multiple parts of spring framework, StAX `XMLInputFactory`, `SourceHttpMessageConverter`, and the Spring OXM wrapper using the `JAXB marshaller`. these issues are all problems with external entity resolution not being disabled, and use the CVEs: \n\nCVE-2013-6429\nCVE-2013-7315\nCVE-2013-4152\n\nThese issues were all worked on and were supposedly fixed in Jan 2014 (version **4.0.0** and version **3.2.5**), however it was later revealed that the fixes for these issues were incomplete, with a new CVE being assigned: CVE-2014-0054. The incorrect fix was corrected in versions **3.2.8** and **4.0.2**.An XML external entities (XXE) vulnerability has been discovered in Spring Framework. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a malicious XML file to disclosure sensitive information, execute server side request forgery (SSRF) or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.Spring Framework is vulnerable to directory traversal due to the incorrect sanitization of client-provided URLs.
